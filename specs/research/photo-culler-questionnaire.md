# Photo Culler — Questionnaire for Tino

Answer inline, skip anything you're not sure about yet. Murray will pick these up at the start of the next session.

## Your Current Workflow

1. **Walk me through a typical job from card to delivery.** What's the actual sequence? (e.g., insert card → ingest to folder → open Photo Mechanic → rate/cull → move selects to Lightroom → edit → export → deliver) *That's pretty accurate.*

2. **What software do you currently use at each step?** (Photo Mechanic, Lightroom, Capture One, etc.) *Photo Mechanic & Lightroom*

3. **What's your typical volume per job?** Give a few examples:
   - Headshot session: 100 images
   - Sports game: 1500 images
   - Conference/event: 700 images
   - Other: ___

4. **How long does culling typically take you?** (rough time per job type) *Headshots 15 min; Single game 30 min; Conference 20 min; These are estimates for the first pass to identify highlights. There's a second pass that more broadly identifies keepers and a cleanup pass to delete rejects*

5. **What's your culling methodology?** (e.g., single pass with stars, multiple passes narrowing down, color labels for categories, reject-first then select) *First pass with 4-5 stars for highlights*


6. **What's your fastest turnaround requirement?** (e.g., "client needs 10 hero shots posted to social within 30 min of the game ending") *A championship photo within 2 minutes of the game ending -- for that one I usually try to identify the image from the back of the camera and wirelessly send it to my phone to forward to the client. More often 5-10 hero shots within 1 hour of the end of the event*

7. **Do you cull on-site or back at your workstation?** If on-site, what hardware? (laptop model) *Oftentimes on a laptop on-site. M1 Mac or faster*

## What Frustrates You Today

8. **What's the #1 thing that slows you down in the cull?** *The large quantity of files to review*

9. **What does Photo Mechanic do well that we absolutely cannot regress on?** *Speed of rendering the files while scrolling*

10. **What does Photo Mechanic do poorly or not at all?** *any sort of burst grouping or automated selection*

11. **Have you tried any AI culling tools (Aftershoot, Imagen, etc.)?** If so, what was your experience? *no*

## AI-Assisted Culling

12. **Shot list workflow**: When a client gives you a shot list, what does it typically look like? Can you paste an actual example?

13. **"Hero shot" definition**: When you're identifying hero shots, what are you looking for? Is it purely technical (sharpest, best expression, best composition) or also narrative (captures the moment, tells a story)? *Most typically narrative, even when a photo isn't technically perfect (in focus, etc), the moment can be what makes it. The hero shot might not be the full frame either -- a more refined crop can elevate an othewise banal composition to a winner*

14. **Burst selection**: When picking from a burst, what's your decision process? Sharpest? Best expression? Best body position? All of the above? *all the above*

15. **Would you trust AI to auto-reject?** Or should it only suggest, with you making the final call? *Should only suggest. Sometimes there are elements to a photo that make it stand out regardless of specific "technical faults"*

16. **Training on your style**: If the tool learned from your past culling patterns, how would you expect that to work? Should it start from scratch each time, or build a persistent model of your preferences? *should build a persistent model that could be reset if desired*

17. **How important is explainability?** Do you want the AI to tell you *why* it flagged something (e.g., "eyes closed", "soft focus on subject's face"), or just a score/ranking? *the why could be helpful, being able to teach it that other factors can overweigh "eyes closed" would be an improvement on strict rules following*

---

## Semantic Search

18. **How would you use text search in practice?** Give me 3-5 real searches you'd want to run during a cull. *for a sporting event: photo of a player looking focused / determined, photo of teammates celebrating, sequence of photos of a player scoring a goal, dynamic photo of a block, pensive photo of the coach*

19. **Should search work across multiple jobs/sessions?** Or only within the current photoset? *optimize for searching within the current photoset*

20. **Face search**: Would "show me all photos of [person X]" be useful? (e.g., client asks for all shots of a specific speaker) *absolutely!*

---

## Delivery & Integration

21. **What's your delivery format?** (JPEG exports? Online gallery? Direct to social media?)

22. **Does this tool need to talk to Lightroom/Capture One?** If so, how? (XMP sidecars? Catalog export? Just a folder of selects?) *XMP sidecars for importing to Lightroom*

23. **IPTC/metadata**: Do you embed metadata (captions, keywords, copyright) during the cull? Or later in post?

24. **Tethered shooting**: Do you ever shoot tethered? Would you want images appearing in the tool in real-time as you shoot?

## Product Vision

25. **If this tool existed today, what's the ONE feature that would make you switch from Photo Mechanic?** *Better burst handling — grouping, best-pick, sequence navigation*

26. **Who's the target user beyond yourself?** (Sports photographers? Wedding photographers? Event photographers? News/editorial? All of the above?) *Sports, wedding, and event photographers — with customized defaults for each type*

27. **Pricing model thoughts**: Subscription? One-time purchase? Freemium? What do photographers in your circle prefer?

28. **Platform**: Mac-only to start? Or Mac + Windows from day one? *Would like both for broader market. Need to understand tradeoffs vs Mac-only.*

29. **Name ideas?** Or should we brainstorm later?

---

## Technical Preferences

30. **Privacy**: Confirm — all AI processing local, no images leaving the machine? Or are you open to optional cloud features? *nothing leaves the machine*

31. **File format priority**: Which RAW formats must work from day one? (CR3, ARW, NEF, DNG, others?) *NEF is critical for me but should widely support all major brands*

32. **Storage**: Do you work off internal SSD, external SSD, or NAS? Does the tool need to handle images on slow storage gracefully? *should optimize for internal/external SSD -- someone working in the field*
